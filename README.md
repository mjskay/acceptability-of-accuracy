Tool to Connect Classifier Evaluation to Acceptability of Accuracy. _CHI 2015_
(upcoming). http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702603

It is intended to allow others to adopt our tool for generating surveys and
modelling acceptability of accuracy. It is currently a work-in-progress. If you
have any questions, please email Matthew Kay (above). Also, if you've done 
something cool with this work, we'd love to hear from you!
